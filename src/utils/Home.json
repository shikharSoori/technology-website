      "description": "`When it came to trading organizations related to heavy machines like bulldozers, drills, and rollers, high standards were set for the items that were brought in. Every part of the work was done with extra focus, from maintaining the machines to delivering them and their parts to the respective customers. The high cost of these products meant that even the slightest error could result in significant losses, as many industries depended directly on the use of this machinery. Most of the machines and their parts were imported from Korea, China, or India, which made the cost of working in this industry higher than in any other industry. Consequently, there were very few companies that dealt with heavy machinery. Additionally, maintenance costs skyrocketed due to the limited availability of the human and technical resources needed to maintain these items. Despite these challenges, industry giants managed to both rent and sell new heavy hardware to manufacturing companies all over Nepal. Their ability to uphold high standards and focus meticulously on every detail ensured their continued success in a highly demanding and interconnected market.`",
